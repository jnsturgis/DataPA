# Things todo to get this course ready.

1. Ask Corine for examples of enzymes that she will treat with potentially
  datasets and structures of E and ES for several examples.
  1. Structure TP 2, 3
  2. Structure exercise
  3. Analysis cooperative enzyme or global analysis.
2. Find datasets and example figures for
  1. Analysis TP 1, 2
  2. Analysis exercise.
  3. Structure TP 1 figure to reproduce.
  4. Malformed datasets for Figures TP 2, 3
  5. Example figures for Figures TP 4
  6. Example figures for Figures exercise
3. Contact Pascal for information on his course in St Charles L3 for

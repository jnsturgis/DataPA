# DataPA
Programs and materials for a course on biochemical and biophysical data
presentation and analysis.

This course is composed of 5 lectures/demonstrations and debriefing sessions
of 2 hours each as well as 10 work sessions on computers.
The objective of this course is to teach students:
1. How to produce publication quality figures of a variety of types.
2. How to analyze, interpret and present quantitative data.
3. How to program and manipulate molecular structures to analyse structures and
to produce presentations of structural information.

The tools used for this will be ChimeraX, and Python with the libraries
matplotlib, scipy and numpy in particular. The python programming will be
designed in an interactive jupyter notebook environment.

The teaching methods will essentially be based on the learning by doing paradigm
with a series of exercises, giving variable amounts of guidance, and restitution
sessions where the results will be discussed and choices analyzed.
These activities will be organized through jupyter notebooks.
Evaluation will be based on project/exercise results.
After an initial introduction explaining the organization of the course, the
expectations and timetable there will be three sections to the teaching and
exercises:
1. Making graphs and figures
2. Numerical data analysis and modeling
3. Structural exploration and presentation

These are described in more detail below with the different exercises and
objectives.

The course starts with an [introductory lecture](Introduction.pdf) in which I will explain:
1. Course organization and grading (projects)
2. Theory about how to make nice figures (Tufte and 10 figures)
3. A bit of theory about modelling, fitting and data analysis.
4. Some examples of protein structure and illustrations.
5. Where to find information and help.

Then the following sessions will be organized in the computer rooms and involve
decrypting and following teaching/example notebooks, or working on projects to
produce various figures and analyses.

## Making graphs and figures
This first section will include:
1. [Demonstration notebook](Figure1.ipynb) producing a simple figure.
2. [Learning notebook](Figure2.ipynb) correct the code style to produce a more
   complex 2 part figure from data in datafiles.
3. [Set of figures](Figures.pdf) and associated data (about 32) of varying
   difficulty (I need to have the code for these) to reproduce as a project.

## Numerical data analysis and modeling
This section will include:
1. [Demonstartion notebook](Analysis1.ipynb) about simple statistical tests on
   datasets and p-values for comparing datasets.
2. [Learning notebook](Analysis2.ipynb) on linear regression analysis and
   homoscedacity, linear trends and linearizations.
3. [Learning notebook](Analysis3.ipynb) on non-linear regression compared to
   linearization and predicting model parameters by regression. Parameter
   correlations, regression robustness. F test for model comparison.
4. [Learning notebook](Analysis4.ipynb) on spectrum analysis and component
   contributions and global analysis of multidimensional data.
5. [Exercise notebook](Analysis5.ipynb) to analyse a dataset and produce a
   convincing analysis and figure.

## Structural exploration and presentation
The final section will examine:
1. [Demonstration program](Structure1.ipynb) producing an annotated image of a
   structure with ChimeraX. (Reproduce an example Hb, but with some external
   data added).
2. [Set of figures and movies](Structures.pdf) and associated data (about 32)
   of varying complexity (I need to have code for these) to produce as a project.

That is in total there will be:
1. An introductory course.
2. 3 Demonstration notebooks - one for each part of the course.
3. 4 Learning notebooks
4. 1 Graded exercise notebook
5. Ideally 64 figures and movies with associated data to reproduce.

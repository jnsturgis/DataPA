# DataPA
Programs and materials for a course on biochemical and biophysical data
presentation and analysis.

This course is composed of 5 lectures and debriefing sessions of 2 hours each
as well as 10 work sessions on computers.
The objective of this course is to teach students:
1. How to produce publication quality figures of a variety of types.
2. How to analyze, interpret and present quantitative data.
3. How to program and manipulate molecular structures to analyse structures and
to produce presentations of structural information.

The tools used for this will be ChimeraX, and Python with the libraries
matplotlib, scipy and numpy in particular. The python programming will be
designed in an interactive jupyter notebook environment.

The teaching methods will essentially be based on the learning by doing paradigm
with a series of exercises, giving variable amounts of guidance, and restitution
sessions where the results will be discussed and choices analyzed.
Evaluation will be based on project/exercise results.
After an initial introduction explaining the organization of the course, the
expectations and timetable there will be three sections to the teaching and
exercises:
1. Making graphs and figures
2. Numerical data analysis and modeling
3. Structural exploration and presentation

These are described in more detail below with the different exercises and
objectives.

## Making graphs and figures
This first section will examine:
1. What makes a good, bad or great figure or graph. (Theory and examples)
2. How to manipulate data from tables and files to re-organize it for analysis
  and presentation (Data wrangling in python)
3. Practice producing different types of graphs and with quantitative elements.
4. Integrating multiple elements into figures
5. Exercise produce a publication quality multi-element figure from the relevant
  datasets.

## Numerical data analysis and modeling
This section will examine:
1. Simple statistical tests on datasets and p-values for comparing datasets.
2. Linear regression analysis and homoscedacity, linear trends and
linearizations.
3. Non-linear regression compared to linearization and predicting model
  parameters by regression. Parameter correlations, regression robustness. F test
  for model comparison.
4. Spectrum analysis and component contributions and global analysis of
  multidimensional data.
5. Exercise to analyse a multicomponent kinetic trace and produce a convincing
figure.

## Structural exploration and presentation
The final section will examine:
1. Producing a simple annotated image of a structure with ChimeraX. (Reproduce
  an example Hb)
2. Combining multiple representations and schemes to produce a more complex
  figure. (Reproduce an example - active site and mutants type.)
3. Structure analysis hydrogen bonds and enzyme-substrate binding site (Like an
  example but with a different enzyme)
4. Building and programming a movie from a story board.
5. Exercise figure comparing the structure of active sites of same enzyme from
  2 species and interpreting changes in kinetic parameters.
